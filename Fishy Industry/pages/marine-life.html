          Whales
        </h2>
        <p>
          Whales are vital for the health of the ocean ecosystem. They help
          fertilize marine plants called phytoplankton when they excrete waste.
          These phytoplankton absorb 4x more carbon dioxide than the Amazon
          rainforest. There have been laws to protect whales like the
          international whaling ban since 1986 but there are numerous countries
          whaling illegally. Most notorious of them is Japan. They have been
          rounding whales and dolphins secretly into coves illegally. The
          whaling site is so protected that authorities spy on your activities
          right when you enter the location. They are able to do all this with
          funding from the marine park entertainment industry. Young, wild
          dolphins and whales are expensive so catched dolphins and whales are
          sold to the industry. However, for every one dolphin captured, 12 were
          killed. Why are the fishermans killing more dolphins than capturing
          them?

          Dolphins
        </h2>
        <p>
          Just like whales, dolphins also help fertilize phytoplankton when they
          excrete waste. They are vital in the ecosystem. Unfortunately, just
          like whales, they are killed by commercial fishing. They are either
          killed by bycatch or intentionally for other reasons. One reasoning
          was to control fish populations. They were killing dolphins so that
          there were more fish in the ocean for fishermans to catch. However,
          killing dolphins was just a scapegoat to continue Japanâ€™s 40 million
          dollar bluefin tuna industry. The bluefin industry was using dolphins
          as their reasoning for the fish stock dropping. Bluefins are rare and
          expensive but there is a high demand. Due to the bluefin industry,
          less than 3% of pacific bluefin tuna remain from decades ago.

          Sea Turtles
        </h2>
        <p>
          Although, there are no fisheries that target sea turtles their
          populations are still plummeting. 6 out of the 7 sea turtle species
          are endangered due to bycatch. Approximately 1,000 sea turtles are
          killed by plastic per year. That is nothing compared to how many sea
          turtles are killed in the US per year. In the US alone, 250,000
          turtles are killed per year.

          Sharks
        </h2>
        <p>
          Not only does Japan kill dolphins, whales, and bluefin tuna, they are
          killing sharks too. Japan has a shark finning industry that captures
          sharks and cuts off their fins to export to China. After cutting their
          fins, they are thrown back to the ocean but the majority already died
          before returning back to the ocean. Shark fin soup is a status symbol
          in China. They are only a status symbol. Shark fins have no
          nutritional value and they have little to no taste. Sharks play a
          massive role in the marine ecosystem. Sharks are on the very top of
          the food chain or we can call them level 1 animals. Level 1 animals
          eat level 2 animals. Without level 1 animals, level 2 animals will
          have no predators and over populate quickly. Level 2 will eat all the
          level 3 fish and die out. This chain reaction will continue to the
          organisms on the bottom of the food chain. Without sharks, the ocean
          will be an empty wasteland, and without a thriving ocean, we will all
          die.
