          Sustainable Fishing
        </h2>
        <p>
          Commercial fishing is essentially wildlife poaching on a mass scale.
          Up to 2.7 trillion fish are caught every year. Global fish populations
          are plummeting to near extinction and if we continue on this trend,
          the ocean will be empty by 2048. We need a quick solution. There has
          been a phrase spreading around the internet which is sustainable
          fishing. Well, there is no such thing as sustainable fishing.
          Sustainable fishing is just a marketing phrase to get people
          supporting the corporation. Corporations will not come out against
          hunting, fishing and meat eating because they fear the loss of
          membership support. Oceana is the largest marine conservation group.
          In their website, there is no mention of reducing or eliminating
          seafood consumption anywhere. In addition, they recommend the best way
          to save fish is to eat fish.

          Subsidies
        </h2>
        <p>
          Overfishing has caused gobal fish populations to fall. When there are
          less fish, fish becomes more valuable but why arn't their prices
          inscreasing substantially? Well, it's because we subsidies them.
          Subsidy is taxpayer money that is given to an industry to keep the
          price of a product or service artificially low. One of these subsidies
          is the fishing industry. Governments go to extreme measures to prevent
          people from exposing the economic activities that they subsist on at
          sea. If they do get exposed, corporations might lose all their money,
          fishermans will lose their jobs, and the whole industry might fall
          apart. There is an increasing number of countries that are pouring
          more money to catch fish than the value of fish coming back in. So
          even though you don’t eat fish, you are still sustaining fisheries
          because you are paying it in your taxes. Your taxes go to the
          government to subsidise fishing, to keep the fishing industry afloat
          (pun unintended) and allow you to purchase seafood at a low price.
          Imagine just saying that. How corrupted does that sound? Subsidies
          originally started as a means to ensure food security by having fish
          prices so low that anyone can afford them. Now subsidies are the cause
          of food insecurity in many developing nations.

          Food Insecurity
        </h2>
        <p>
          It’s easy to guess that overfishing will result in food insecurities
          especially for developing nations that heavily relies on seafood for
          food. Once your area of water no longer has fish inside, people will
          go far and wide to look for fish. And one place with an abundance of
          fish and the only places with a thriving ecosystem left is the
          continent Africa. Fishing by the European Union in places like West
          Africa is driven by European Union subsidies. Large efficient fishing
          vessels fishing around African waters leaves local fishing businesses
          unprofitable and without fish. One of the causes of the infamous
          pirates of Somalia that are feared across the world were actually once
          fishermans working to feed their families. When Somalia fell for civil
          war, foreign illegal fishing vessels invaded their waters and began
          taking their fish, which is effectively pulling food from Somalians'
          mouths. This is giving Somali fishermen no choice but to move into
          another line of work which is piracy. Without seafood, people had to
          hunt wildlife for food. This does not only have devastating impacts on
          life on land but wildlife carry diseases like ebola that can spread
          and lead to an epidemic. The theft of fish stock in Africa is causing
          ebola outbreaks in West Africa.

          Forced Labor
        </h2>
        <p>
          Surprisingly, there is forced labor in the fishing industry. In such
          an ordinary industry, there is forced labor. Most notable is Thailand,
          where more than 50,000 fisheries fish under the Thai flag. There was
          so much competition for fish that fishermens needed to find a way to
          fish cheaply due to the lack of fish being caught. They don't have
          efficent ships or technology to reduce the cost of fishing so free and
          cheap labor is their only option. Slaves were abused and harmed in
          ships and even thrown off ships if they misbehaved. The government
          even has authorities to help cover up the illegal activities and
          prevent exposure.
