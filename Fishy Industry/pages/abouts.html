          About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
          My name is Stanley Lam and I am a rising Junior at Lowell. I am
          currently an intern at Code Tenderloin learning about web development
          and design. This website is my final project for the program. I
          watched the Seaspiracy documentary a few weeks ago and I was
          astonished by the corrupted fishing industry and the immense amount of
          damage the industry was causing and has caused. I was shocked about
          the secrets of the fishing industry and what our governments were
          hiding. I was moved by the film so I decided that my final project for
          my internship was to create an informative website about the
          documentary and let others learn and discover the secrets that the
          fishing industry was hiding.
