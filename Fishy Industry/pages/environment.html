          Garbage Patch
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Great Pacific garbage patch is approximately 1.6 million square
          kilometers long and garbage truck loads of garbage are dumped into the
          ocean every minute. Plastic in the ocean slowly breaks down into small
          microplastics which seeps into every living creature in the ocean.
          Those fish get eaten by other fish or get caught and eaten by us. We
          are eating the plastics that we dump into the ocean. Plastic is
          definitely a huge problem in the ocean. It is such a big problem that
          it is worse than the worst oil spill ever recorded. The worst oil
          spill occured in the Gulf of Mexico. That oil spill killed a lot of
          marine animals but guess what, one day of fishing in the Gulf of
          Mexico killed more fish than the oil spill did in one month. Marine
          life in that area actually benefited from the oil spill because there
          was a lot less fishing going on in the contaminated waters. Although
          plastic in the ocean seems like a massive problem that needs to be
          fixed right away, even if not a single piece of garbage ends up in the
          ocean from today onwards, we will still be ripping the ecosystem apart
          due to commercial fishing. In addition, more than ⅓ of the plastic in
          the ocean is fishing nets or fishing gear. The most talked about
          plastic which is plastic straws, make up less than 0.03% of the
          plastics in the ocean. Why are we so focused on reducing plastic straw
          usage when fishing nets and gear make up more of the plastic than
          straws?

          Trawling
        </h2>
        <p>
          Trawling is by far the most destructive form of fishing. Trawling is
          like the deforestation of the ocean. Trawling is a method of fishing
          where a giant net is being pulled across the water by boats. These
          nets drag heavy weights onto the bottom of the ocean, scaring the sea
          floor and leaving a barren wasteland behind. The largest trawls are so
          huge, they can swallow up to 13 jumbo jet planes. To imagine how
          destructive trawling is, every year, approximately 25 million acres of
          forest are destroyed from bulldozing which is equivalent to losing 27
          soccer fields of forest every minute. Bottom trawling wipes out 3.9
          billion acres every year which is equivalent to losing 4,300 soccer
          fields very single minute. That is really mind boggling. This is why
          coral reefs around our coasts are all gone.

          Climate Change
        </h2>
        <p>
          Overfishing has big impacts on our climate. It might be what you are
          thinking but the animals that move up and down to move across water
          help the ocean absorb the heat from the atmosphere. As animals move,
          warmer water comes down to mix with the colder water below. The power
          of animals moving up and down is as great as all the wind, waves,
          tides and currents in the world combined. Life in the ocean is crucial
          for holding onto carbon and preventing it from being released to the
          atmosphere. Animals take in carbon and when they die, the carbon sinks
          down to the bottom of the ocean essentially making the ocean a large
          carbon sink. 90% of the world’s carbon is stored in the ocean and per
          acre, coastal plants store 20x more carbon than forests. Although
          planting trees and slowing down deforestation can help with climate
          change, ultimately, saving the ocean will play a bigger role in
          addressing climate change. To address climate change you have to
          protect the ocean and to protect the ocean, simply leave it alone. A
          great thing about the marine ecosystem is that it can easily bounce
          back to normal if we let it happen.
